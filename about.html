    <h2>What is a Property Adjustment?</h2>  
    <p> When you buy or sell a property, there are various ongoing costs and expenses associated with the property. These costs are often pre-paid or accrued over time, and the ownership of the property changes during the middle of these periods. A property adjustment is a financial calculation that ensures these costs are fairly divided between the buyer and the seller based on the actual date of transfer.
    </p>

    <h2>Why are property adjustments used</h2>
    <p>Property adjustments are used to ensure that both the buyer and the seller pay their fair share of any ongoing costs or receive their fair share of any pre-paid expenses. These adjustments are crucial for a smooth property transaction because they help avoid disputes and ensure a fair division of expenses.      
        </p>    
    
    <h2>Common types of adjustments</h2>

    <ol>
        <li >
            <b>Council Rates:</b> Local councils charge rates to property owners to fund services such as waste collection and local infrastructure. These rates are usually billed annually or quarterly. If a property is sold partway through a billing period, the rates need to be adjusted so that both the seller and the buyer pay only for the time they own the property.
        
        </li>
        <li class="li">
            <b>Water Rates</b>: Similar to council rates, water authorities charge for the supply of water and sewerage services. Adjustments ensure that these costs are shared fairly based on the ownership period.
        </li>
        <li class="li">
            <b>Owners Corporation Fees:</b> For properties within a strata scheme, such as apartments, owners corporation (or body corporate) fees cover the maintenance of common areas and facilities. Adjustments ensure these fees are divided appropriately.
        </li>
        <li class="li">
            <b>Land Tax:</b> If applicable, land tax is charged based on the ownership of land as of a specific date. Adjustments may be necessary if the tax has been paid in advance or is due shortly after the property transfer.
        </li>    
        </ol>
